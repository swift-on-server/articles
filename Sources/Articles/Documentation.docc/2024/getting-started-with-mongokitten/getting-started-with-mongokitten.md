# Getting Started with MongoDB in Swift using MongoKitten

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. [MongoKitten](https://github.com/orlandos-nl/MongoKitten) provides a Swift-native way to interact with MongoDB, complete with type-safe queries and Codable support.

Learn how to integrate MongoDB with your Swift application using MongoKitten. This tutorial shows you how to set up a connection, work with BSON data, and perform basic database operations.

## Setting Up MongoDB

The quickest way to get started with MongoDB is using Docker. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
```

> Note: For production environments, refer to the [official MongoDB installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

### Adding MongoKitten to Your Project

First, add MongoKitten to your package dependencies:

```swift
// Package.swift
let package = Package(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/orlandos-nl/MongoKitten.git", from: "7.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyApp",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "MongoKitten", package: "MongoKitten")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

## Connecting to MongoDB

Let's create our first connection:

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/mongokitten-basics", slice: "connection")

### Defining Our Models

For our social network, we'll create a Post model using the ``Codable`` protocol:

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/mongokitten-models", slice: "models")

The ``ObjectId`` type is MongoDB's native unique identifier, similar to a ``UUID``. Every document in MongoDB has an `_id` field, which must be unique within a collection. 

### Creating Posts

Let's create a function to save posts:

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/mongokitten-basics", slice: "insert")

1. Create the post as a regular Swift struct
2. Access the posts ``MongoCollection``, this is similar to a table in a relational database
3. Call the ``MongoCollection.insertEncoded(_:writeConcern:)`` method to insert the post into the database. This method automatically converts the object to BSON and inserts it into the database.

In BSON, all entities are stored as '**documents**'.

### Reading Posts

To read posts, we can use MongoKitten's query API:

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/mongokitten-basics", slice: "find-all")

All the methods are chainable, and modify the query. MongoKitten will only execute the query when you call ``MongoCursor.drain``, or iterate over the results of any query.

Before draining the query, you can also call ``QueryCursor.decode(_:using:)`` to decode the results into a specific type. This takes the database rows (documents) and decodes them into the specified ``Decodable`` type.

The drain function will execute the query and return the results as an array of the specified type.

> Note: If your dataset is large, consider streaming the results instead of using ``MongoCursor.drain``. This is more memory efficient, and allows you to process the results incrementally.

### Filtering Results

MongoKitten supports filtering and sorting on most queries.

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/mongokitten-basics", slice: "find-by-author")

The ``MongoCollection.find(_:) [7HX5V]`` method returns a ``FindQueryBuilder``, a type of ``MongoCursor`` that allows you to chain more methods.

### Sorting and Limiting

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/mongokitten-basics", slice: "find-recent")

The **find** method accepts one argument, a filter. By providing the find filter, MongoDB will only return documents that match the filter.

Then, chain the following methods:

- ``FindQueryBuilder.sort(_:) [5UP4H]`` allows you to sort the results by one or more fields.
- ``FindQueryBuilder.limit(_:)`` allows you to limit the number of results returned.

### Understanding BSON

MongoDB, and by extension MongoKitten, uses ``BSON`` (Binary JSON) as its native data format. While MongoKitten handles most BSON conversions automatically through Codable, you can also work with BSON directly:

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/mongokitten-basics", slice: "bson")

## Next Steps
