# Using Hummingbird's Request Context

[Hummingbird](https://hummingbird.codes) introduces a new feature that is essential in how it integrates with other libraries: the ``RequestContext``.

This article explains what they're used for, and how they can help you build statically checked and performant applications.

## The Core

This protocol is implemented by metadata containers. Alongside each ``Request``, Hummingbird creates one instance of this Context. This context functions as a metadata container, and stores properties alongside the request.

The ``RequestContext`` protocol has one main requirement: It needs store a ``CoreRequestContextStorage``.

The CoreRequestContextStorage is a container that the framework uses to store properties _it needs_. While the amount of properties are limited right now, this allows the framework to add more features in the future without breaking your code.

In addition, a context can specify a ``RequestDecoder`` and ``ResponseEncoder``. These types can read the headers and body of a request, and encode a response body, respectively. This is usually backed by a codable implementation such as ``JSONEncoder``. Since Swift bundles a JSON implementation through Foundation, this is the default.

While the en- and decoder usually focus on one content type such as JSON, it's also possible for a context to support multiple content types.

Finally, a request specifies ``RequestContext/maxUploadSize [requirement]``, which has a sensible default value. This specifies the maximum amount of data that Hummingbird may send to a ``RequestDecoder`` before rejecting the request.

## Custom Contexts

Hummingbird provides a very simple context called ``BasicRequestContext``, which is used by default. It's a good starting point for applications, but most applications need custom contexts.

To create a custom context, create a struct that conforms to the ``RequestContext`` protocol. This struct stores any properties related to the request.

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/HummingbirdRequestContext", slice: custom_request_context)

The context is not to be used for dependency injection, such as a database connection. If a property is shared between requests, inject that type in the controller instead. <!-- TODO: Tutorial -->

From here, instantiate a ``Router`` instance using the new context as a basis.

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/HummingbirdRequestContext", slice: router)

### Authentication

When working with Hummingbird, contexts are a very essential part of any application. It's the glue between the framework, other libraries and routes.

So far you've seen the context be used to relay information on a request level between the framework, middlewares and routes. However, some libraries need to know more contextual information. For example, a JWT library can provide knowledge on the user that is making the request.

To do this, you can extend your context with a new property that stores the user information. This can be a simple struct that stores the user's ID, or a more complex type that stores the user's permissions.

### Middleware

<!-- TODO: Middleware tutorial -->

Middleware are powerful tools that allow intercepting requests and responses, and modify them as needed. This is a great place to add authentication, logging, or other cross-cutting concerns.

In Hummingbird, the middleware system is also designed with contexts in mind. When a request is received, the context is created and along between middleware. The middleware can then modify the context as needed.

First, create a middleware type that conforms to the ``RouterMiddleware`` protocol. Then, modify the properties in the context from the ``MiddlewareProtocol/handle(_:context:next:)`` method.

While middleware can specify a `typealias` to constrain to a specific context, it's also possible make a middleware generic.

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/HummingbirdRequestContext", slice: simple_middleware)

### Context Protocols

In the example above, the middleware specifies the type of Context it needs. However, using the power of Swift's generics, it's possible to make a middleware that works with different custom ``RequestContext``s.

First, specify a protocol that the context must conform to. This protocol can be as simple as a marker protocol, or it can specify properties that the middleware needs.

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/HummingbirdRequestContext", slice: context_protocol)

Then, remove the `typealias` and replace it with a generic parameter. This parameter is constrained to the new protocol.

@Snippet(path: "site/Snippets/HummingbirdRequestContext", slice: context_protocol_middleware)

That's all you need to do! Now, the middleware can be used with any context that conforms to the protocol.

## Conclusion

Many of Hummingbird's features are built around the ``RequestContext``. It's a powerful tool that allows you to build statically checked and performant applications. By using the context, you can integrate with other libraries, add authentication, and more.
